# odris
ODRIS - the first letter abbreviation of Oracle Database Routine Inspection Shell and SQL Script.
Before you use this source code of my Shell and SQL script files you first read this license file seriously (https://github.com/guestart/odris/blob/master/LICENSE).
As you can see odris has included two section "odris_aix" and "odris_linux".
